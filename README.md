The MATLAB PPT report was organized by me based on youtube '응용수학자 MATLAB' lecture.

The PPT consists of 9 parts,<br/>
-> What is MATLAB (매트랩이란)<br/>
-> Using Command Window (명령창 이용)<br/>
-> Using Script (편집기 이용)<br/>
-> MATLAB coding grammar (문법)<br/>
-> About function (함수)<br/>
-> About file input/output (파일 입출력)<br/>
-> About two-dimentional graphs (2차원 그래프)<br/>
-> About three-dimentional graphs (3차원 그래프)<br/>
-> Using Excel data (엑셀 데이터 이용)
